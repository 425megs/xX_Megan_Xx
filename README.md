# Refactoring Horiseon Webpage



## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Description
--This webpage meets accessibility standards as determined by WAVE--

This webpage was built to highlight the company, Horiseon Social Solution Services. The motivation for working on this webpage was to improve accessibility by fixing low-contrast areas, fixing broken links and adding ALT tags to all images.

Initially, the code contained many classes and divs. I changed many of the div tags to more fitting section tags to reduce redundancies and duplicate classes/ids. I was able to reduce the total number of lines on the CSS sheet by about 70 lines by streamlining these tag names. This has helped improve the codebase's long-term sustainability and overall readability of the code.

Notes added to both the CSS Stylesheet and HTML doc.
